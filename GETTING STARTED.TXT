Quick Start Guide
-----------------


1.	Open a command shell, such as the CMD window on Windows
	or a Terminal window on Mac OS X.
	
2.	Set default directory to the location where jbasic.jar
	is located.  There is one located in the JBasic runtime
	folder, and there can be one in the JBasic source folder.
	
	If you have the source folder but do not have the jar,
	you can use Eclipse or Ant to create the jar.
	
3.	Invoke the jar as a main program, as in

		java -jar jbasic.jar
	
4.	Use the HELP command for information on next steps. 
	Additional documentation can be found in the user's
	guide document (a PDF file) located in the "moredoc"
	sub-folder of the project. Additional info can be
	found on the web site:
